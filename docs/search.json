    "text": "In the video, I discussed two graphs that were poorly designed and could potentially lead to misunderstandings. I also proposed four redesigns aimed at enhancing clarity and accuracy. These redesigns include a scatterplot, line chart, bar chart, and map, each tailored to address the shortcomings of the original graphs.\n\nScatterplot: This redesign involves representing data points individually on a graph, allowing viewers to perceive the relationship between variables more distinctly. Scatterplots are especially useful for analyzing correlations between continuous variables, revealing patterns and trends that may not be evident in other types of graphs.\nLine Chart: Line charts excel at illustrating trends over time, making them suitable for comparing changes in data over a continuous period. By connecting data points with lines, viewers can easily track fluctuations and identify patterns, offering a clearer understanding of how variables evolve over time.\nBar Chart: Bar charts are effective for comparing discrete categories or groups of data. In this redesign, each category is depicted by a separate bar, simplifying comparisons between different variables. Bar charts are particularly useful for highlighting disparities between categories and identifying outliers.\nMap: Maps provide a spatial representation of data, making them ideal for visualizing geographical patterns and trends. In this redesign, data points are plotted on a map, enabling viewers to observe how variables vary across different regions. Maps are particularly effective for identifying regional disparities and understanding the geographic distribution of data.\n\nOverall, these redesigns aim to improve the clarity and accuracy of the original graphs by presenting the data in a more visually engaging and informative manner. By selecting the appropriate graph type and applying specific remodeling techniques, viewers can develop a clearer understanding of the data without the risk of misinterpretation.\nBelow is the cheat sheet for codes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 6: cheat sheet for codes (ggplot2)[3]."

(Strengths)\nBy converting into bar graph, we can achieve the following :\n\nThis Bar graphs enable a clear and instant comparison between different variables.\nThis Bar graph provide a two-dimensional portrayal of data, which is often simpler for humans to comprehend compared to raw numerical data. By presenting collapses and deaths on a shared scale, viewers can swiftly grasp the relative variances and trends between the two variables.\nBar graphs make it easy to spot the highest and lowest values for each variable in each month. This can be achieved by observing the tallest and shortest bars. This insight is crucial for understanding the severity of collapses and deaths over time and identifying any exceptional occurrences.\nBy visually representing collapses and deaths side by side, viewers can readily discern patterns and trends. Noting that there are more collapses than deaths in each month, in this case, highlights a potentially significant issue that may warrant further investigation or intervention.\nGraphical representations streamline the communication of insights derived from the data. Instead of presenting viewers with raw figures or extensive tables, a bar graph condenses the information into a visually understandable format, making it easier for stakeholders to comprehend and act upon."
