These axes serve as reference points for interpreting data and provide context for the relationships between variables.\nGraphs typically operate in two dimensions, with data represented along both the x-axis and y-axis. Converting a graph into a 2D format involves simplifying the visualizations.\nOne optional modification would be changing the language of graph to english, as majority viewers can understand and interpret this language very well."
