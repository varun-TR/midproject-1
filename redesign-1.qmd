## Improving to dual axis line chart

-   **Loading Required Libraries**: We start by loading the **`plotly`** library.

    say : library(plotly)

-   **Creating Sample Data**: Next, we create a data frame called **`data`**. This data frame contains three columns: **`month`**, **`collapses`**, and **`deaths`**. **`month`** is a factor variable representing the months of the year, while **`collapses`** and **`deaths`** represent the number of athlete collapses and deaths, respectively, for each month.

```{r}
data <- data.frame(
  month = factor(c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec", "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"),
                 levels = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")),
  collapses = c(7, 6, 16, 17, 20, 28, 46, 57, 81, 109, 116, 124, 126, 73, 120, 55),
  deaths = c(4, 4, 8, 10, 7, 19, 33, 34, 43, 64, 77, 90, 86, 51, 83, 36)
)

```

We specify the data (**`data`**), x-axis (**`~month`**), and y-axis (**`~collapses`**). We set the type of plot as **`'scatter'`** and mode as **`'lines'`**, and name the trace as **`'Collapses'`**. The we plot as shown below:

## Why we re-designed to dual axis line chart? (Strengths)

The line chart effectively displays the trend over time, showcasing that collapses significantly outnumber deaths. The y-axis values are reasonable, aiding in understanding the scale of occurrences.

To enhance clarity in distinguishing collapses from deaths per month, we can consider redesigning the graph as a dual-axis line chart. This modification would enable viewers to clearly visualize and compare the trends of collapses and deaths simultaneously, providing a clearer understanding of the relationship between the two variables.

overall:

-   The current line chart effectively illustrates the trend over time, indicating a significant disparity between collapses and deaths.

-   The y-axis values are appropriately scaled, facilitating comprehension of the magnitude of occurrences.

-   Redesigning the graph as a dual-axis line chart would enhance clarity by allowing viewers to compare collapses and deaths directly, providing a more comprehensive understanding of their relationship and trends over time.

## Weakness of this graph:

-   The y-axis at 40 for collapsed athletes can be misleading, especially if the actual number of collapses is relatively low.

-   The graph lacks a detailed legend to clarify the meaning of different colors. This could be crucial, especially if the graph displays data from various sources or different types of athletes.

-   Reporting practices for collapses and deaths might vary across locations or time periods, making comparisons difficult.

## Improving to bar chart

Lets use the same data set:

```{r}
data <- data.frame(
  month = factor(c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec", "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"),
                 levels = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")),
  collapses = c(7, 6, 16, 17, 20, 28, 46, 57, 81, 109, 116, 124, 126, 73, 120, 55),
  deaths = c(4, 4, 8, 10, 7, 19, 33, 34, 43, 64, 77, 90, 86, 51, 83, 36)
)

```

Then **`plot_ly()`** function initializes the plot by defining the dataset (**`data`**), the variable to be represented on the x-axis (**`~month`**), and the variable to be represented on the y-axis (**`~collapses`**) for collapses. By setting the **`type`** argument to **`'bar'`**, it creates a column bar chart, naming this trace as 'Collapses'.

To incorporate another dataset onto the plot, the **`add_trace()`** function is utilized. Here, it adds a new trace representing the deaths data (**`~deaths`**) against the same months (**`~month`**).

## Why we re-designed to barplot? (Strengths)

By converting into bar graph, we can achieve the following :

-   This Bar graphs enable a clear and instant comparison between different variables.

-   This Bar graph provide a two-dimensional portrayal of data, which is often simpler for humans to comprehend compared to raw numerical data. By presenting collapses and deaths on a shared scale, viewers can swiftly grasp the relative variances and trends between the two variables.

-   Bar graphs make it easy to spot the highest and lowest values for each variable in each month. This can be achieved by observing the tallest and shortest bars. This insight is crucial for understanding the severity of collapses and deaths over time and identifying any exceptional occurrences.

-   By visually representing collapses and deaths side by side, viewers can readily discern patterns and trends. Noting that there are more collapses than deaths in each month, in this case, highlights a potentially significant issue that may warrant further investigation or intervention.

-   Graphical representations streamline the communication of insights derived from the data. Instead of presenting viewers with raw figures or extensive tables, a bar graph condenses the information into a visually understandable format, making it easier for stakeholders to comprehend and act upon.

## Weakness of this graph:

-   The graph might not show the context of the data. For example, it could be missing information about the total number of athletes participating.

-   If the graph uses different colors or symbols to represent data, The legend can be more detailed

-   The graph contains whisks the separate 2021 and 2022 data. It could be better if 2022 data is plotted separately.
